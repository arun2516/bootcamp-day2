SUMMARY ON HOW BROWSER RENDERING AN WEBSITE:
In high level flow of rendering process HTML,CSS are get parse and then =>render tress is formed by combining DOM and CSSOM and=> layout process if happen finally=> paint will happen.
you cant always control the HTML rendered on your page if you have a dynamic content etc..
script tag will always stop the parser from going through the HTML constructor and DOM tree.
so for the performane always keep the script tag in the bottom so it wont affect the parsing process.
use defer will actually defer the execution until its actually done parsing.
Async will work slightly different it will do a seperate thread and actually parse and execute the script in that thread adjacent to the parsing one.
in rendering tree render object has a reference to the DOM object when the DOM node is connected to render object.
